## Group Leader: Kevin Daly

Hello!
I am the leader of the self-styled "Ruminant Palaeogenomics" group at UCD's School of Agriculture and Food Science.

I completed my undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin, where I began my academic career under the mentorship of Prof. Daniel Bradley.
As part of Dan's ERC project "CODEX" I generated the first large scale genomic dataset of an ancient livestock, thus beginning my minor obsession and healthy research interest in goats.

Following my PhD I had the fortunate to collaborate with Dr. Melinda Zeder on material from Ganj Dareh, one of the earliest settlements with robust evidence for goat management.
Expanding the dataset of goat remains with Dr. Marjan Mashkour, Dr. Pernille Bangsgaard, and Dr. Lisa Yeoman, we created a multi-disciplinary collaboration on the world's old managed goat herds, producing [a study I am very proud of](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100901118).

I have also explored the genomics of ancient sheep, a species arguably more important than goats but perhaps less charismatic.
[See here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0222?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org) for a sheep mummy genome, from a specimen we thought was initially goat, led by the peerless Dr. Conor Rossi.

More recently I have been awarded an [SFI Pathways award](https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/trinity-researchers-secure-eight-sfi-irc-pathway-awards/) to explore small ruminant pathogens in the earliest phases of livestock domestication.

I am a member of the first cohort of the [Young Academy of Ireland](https://www.ria.ie/kevin-gerard-daly), the least among an [exceptional group](https://www.ria.ie/bios/young-academy-ireland/all) of young researchers and leaders.

I am a proponent to alternative peer review publishing models, and have [submitted manuscripts](https://genomics.peercommunityin.org/articles/rec?id=162) through the Peer Community In system.
I look forward to doing so again and hope to support the movement in any way I can.

In my free time I watch films and maintain a list of [the best goat roles in cinema](https://boxd.it/4BHse).
You won't believe what's at number one!
