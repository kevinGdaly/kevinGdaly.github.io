I completed my undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin, where I began my academic career under the mentorship of Prof. Daniel Bradley.
As part of Dan's ERC project "CODEX" I generated the [first large scale genomic dataset of an ancient livestock](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aas9411), thus beginning my minor obsession and healthy research interest in goats.

Following my PhD I had the fortunate to collaborate with Dr. Melinda Zeder on material from Ganj Dareh, one of the earliest settlements with robust evidence for goat management.
Expanding the dataset of goat remains with Dr. Marjan Mashkour, Dr. Pernille Bangsgaard, and Dr. Lisa Yeoman, we created a multi-disciplinary collaboration on the world's old managed goat herds, producing [a study I am very proud of](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100901118).

I have also explored the genomics of ancient sheep, a species arguably more important than goats but perhaps less charismatic.
[See here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0222?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org) for a sheep mummy genome, from a specimen we thought was initially goat, led by the peerless Dr. Conor Rossi.

More recently I have been awarded an [SFI Pathways award](https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/trinity-researchers-secure-eight-sfi-irc-pathway-awards/) to explore small ruminant pathogens in the earliest phases of livestock domestication.

I am a member of the first cohort of the [Young Academy of Ireland](https://www.ria.ie/kevin-gerard-daly), the least among an [exceptional group](https://www.ria.ie/bios/young-academy-ireland/all) of young researchers and leaders.

I am a proponent to alternative peer review publishing models, and have [submitted manuscripts](https://genomics.peercommunityin.org/articles/rec?id=162) through the "Peer Community In" system.
I look forward to doing so again and hope to support the movement in any way I can.

In my free time I watch films and maintain a list of [the best goat roles in cinema](https://boxd.it/4BHse).
You won't believe what's at number one!

Hello!


I’m Jolijn Erven, a Postdoc in Daly’s Ruminant Palaeogenomics working group.


I completed my master’s training in genetics at Wageningen University, where I strengthened my fascination with animal domestication, evolution, and behaviour.

This interest led me to pursue a PhD at the Groningen Institute of Archaeology, where I worked on the EDAN project.

There, I focused on the domestication processes of cattle and pigs in the Netherlands—and more broadly, Europe—using palaeogenomics to understand how early communities shaped, and were shaped by, the animals they lived alongside.

I am currently exploring the demographic history of domestic goats by studying early herding societies and the dispersal from early domestication centres.

I’m particularly keen on using every tool in our bioinformatics toolbox to better understand demographic shifts and evolutionary processes throughout the past.

I’m especially interested in multidisciplinary approaches—drawing from various fields to trace the origins and adaptations of domestic animals.

More broadly, I’m curious about how animals evolve in response to human or natural environments, and how behaviour, ecology, and genetics intersect in that story.

I strongly believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and enjoy connecting data from different sources to answer long-standing questions about past demographic history.

When I’m not in the lab or wrangling data, I love sharing quirky animal trivia—or just talking your ears off about animals and/or bioinformatics tools.

## PhD Students

### Louis L'Hôte

<br /> <br /> I am Louis, PhD student in ancient pathogen genetics.

After a undegraduate degree in life science i followed a Master in Engineering in Microbiology at the [Faculté des sciences et technologies, Université de Lorraine](https://fst.univ-lorraine.fr/).
Throughout my master degree i got the chance to be part of different research project: In 2021 i worked ancient woolly mammoth microbiota at the [Microbial Palaeogenomics Unit](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/microbial-paleogenomics/) of the Pasteur institute in Paris.

This experience gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about metagenomics techniques and ancient DNA.
It is why in 2022 i decided to do my master thesis in Copenhagen in the [Centre for ExoLife Sciences](https://cels.nbi.ku.dk/english) (CELS) where i used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics techniques to understand how microbes are surviving in Mars-like extreme environment.
<br /> <br /> <img src="louis3.png" width="400"/> <img src="louis1.png" width="300&quot;/"/> <br /> <br /> I am currently Kevin Daly's PhD student and part of the SFI Pathways project "Herd Health"
. Livestock animals were domesticated 10 000 years ago in southwest Asia, but little is known about their health (inbreeding, infectious disease) despite their underpinning of farmer societies
. <br />In the last few years, the advancement of Next generation sequencing techniques has made it possible to reconstruct different genomes of ancient human pathogens from archaeological specimens, such as *Yersinia pestis*, the agent of the Black Death
. So far, the reconstruction of pathogen genomes has mainly been performed on human pathogens
. My work focuses on obtaining pathogen and animal DNA from 10,000 years old sheep and goat material, from the Zagros Mountain in Iran, in order to understand how sheep and goat zoonotic pathogen evolution was shaped by the onset of domestication
.

I'm interested in everything to do with microbes.
From ancient DNA to wet lab.

### Luisa Sacristán

¡Hola! I'm Luisa, and since 2025 I’ve been a PhD student in Kevin Daly’s Ruminant Palaeogenomics group at UCD’s School of Agriculture and Food Science.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Microbiology at the Universidad de Pamplona, Colombia and worked for three years as a quality control microbiologist. In 2020, I started working at [Gencore](https://corefacilities.uniandes.edu.co/gencore/), a sequencing core facility at Universidad de los Andes, where I participated in multiple projects focused on sequencing a wide variety of organisms and microorganisms. Additionally, during the pandemic, I had the honor of joining the [COVIDA](https://www.uniandes.edu.co/es/node/12511) project and later contributed to the sequencing and genomic surveillance efforts in collaboration with Colombia’s National Institute of Health contributing to the detection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. During this time, I gained experience in molecular biology techniques and different sequencing technologies.

The challenge of generating biological data without knowing how to analyze it motivated me to pursue a Master’s degree in Computational Biology at Universidad de los Andes in 2022 joining the [Computational Biology and Microbial Ecology (BCEM)](https://bcem-uniandes.github.io/) group, where I developed strong skills in biological data analysis. As part of my master’s studies, I contributed to the development of a low-cost protocol for full operon sequencing using ONT sequencing to identify bacterial communities. Additionally, I had the wonderful opportunity to join the [Beasts to Craft](https://sites.google.com/palaeome.org/ercb2c/home) project, where I conducted my thesis research focused on metagenomic analysis of bacterial communities found in parchment from historical manuscripts and comparative genomics of pathogens recovered from these materials.

After completing my master’s, in 2024 I joined the [CABANA project](https://cabana.network/elearning), developing  and adapting bioinformatics e-learning courses in both spanish and english aiming to reduce language barriers in Latin America. 

Currently, I am working on my PhD project, which aims to study the co-evolution of livestock and their pathogens by analyzing both the genomes of recovered pathogens and their host animals. (More details coming soon!)

Hello, I'm Xinyi Li. In 2025, I joined Kevin Daly’s Ruminant Palaeogenomics group as a PhD student. Meanwhile, I'm also a jointly - trained PhD student at the Institute of Animal Science of CAAS, under the supervision of Professor Zhangyuan Pan. His research mainly focuses on the genetic breeding of sheep and goats, and he is also very good at epigenomics research.

From 2022 to 2025, I completed my master's thesis at the Institute of Animal Science. My major is Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction. I participated in the research on pigeon genetic breeding and conducted a lot of population genetic studies on the pigeon genome. The above - related research has greatly interested me in bioinformatics analysis, and I want to further strengthen my data analysis ability. I hope to uncover the mysteries of animal evolution history from omics data, find possible traces left by domestication, and further apply them to modern animal breeding work.

Currently, I'm participating in the research on the functional annotation of sheep epigenomics in Professor Pan&#39;s group in China and further strengthening my data analysis ability. In the future, I will also come to Ireland to complete my PhD work.

My PhD project aims to analyze the evolution of epigenetic regulatory elements in ruminants and hopes to obtain some useful information from ancient DNA.
