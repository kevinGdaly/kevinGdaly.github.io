We study this using palaeogenomics - genome data recovered from thousands of years old bones, teeth, and other materials.  With these ancient genomes, we can peek back into prehistory to see how animals have evolved, what were past patterns of biodiversity and how they have changed, and the forces shaping modern animal diversity."

    "text": "** Recruiting PhD students for ERC Porject HERDPATH**\nA European Research Council-funded 4 year PhD project for EU, UK and international applicants is available in the School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Ireland. Highly motivated students are invited to apply for a PhD position within the HERDPATH project, led by Dr. Kevin Daly and the Ruminant Palaeogenomics group.\nHERDPATH is an ambitious project aiming to transform our understanding of how livestock domestication and management shaped both herd and pathogen evolution over the past 10,000 years. Using cutting-edge palaeogenomic approaches, we will analyse ancient DNA from archaeological livestock remains - focusing on sheep and goat but drawing on data from other species - across Eurasia to reveal the dynamic interplay between domestication, pathogen evolution, herd inbreeding, and immune gene variation. PhD projects will focus on either livestock or pathogen genomes, but will be in dialogue with other components of HERDPATH.  ####Context Genetic analysis from ancient animal remains has revealed the dynamics of the early domestication process (e.g. Daly et al 2018 and 2025; Daly et al, 2021; Verdugo et al, 2019). However, little is known about the genomic health of domesticates - the reduction in genetic diversity which may have occurred throughout domestication and its possible consequences to animal resilience to infectious disease. Similarly, ancient genomic analysis has begun to shed light on the genetic history of human pathogens, including some zoonotic agents (e.g. Key et al, 2020; L’Hôte al al. 2024; Light-Maka et al, 2025), but how such zoonoses evolved with their domestic animal hosts is unknown. How livestock-specific pathogens evolved and adapted to their host species is relatively underexplored. Finally, little is understood of the adaptive process in livestock species themselves to these infectious disease threats, and how trends in genetic diversity and inbreeding may have affected herd susceptibility.  The project will generate sequencing data from a diverse range of sheep and goat archaeological remains over the last 10,000 years. Recovered DNA from both host and pathogen sources will be used to reconstruct genomes and chart the interlinked evolution and genetic flux of domestic ruminants and their pathogens, both zoonotic and livestock-specific. The project will involve drawing from multiple disciplines and lines of evidence including genomics, microbial/pathogen evolution, archaeology and zooarchaeology, zoology/veterinary science; a flexible approach and openness to working in multiple disciplines is expected.  The position includes a student stipend of €25,000 per annum for the course of the 4-year PhD and postgraduate fees will be covered. The expected start date will be May 2026 but some flexibility is possible. The successful candidate will have opportunities to present at international & remotely run training courses and academic conferences. Students will be part of a growing research team, with frequency contact with other palaeogenomic teams in Dublin.  A background in any of the following is preferred: biology, genetics & genomics, population genetics, animal genomics, microbial genetics, archaeological science, bioinformatics, mathematical biology. Laboratory, programming and bioinformatic experience (e.g. Linux environment, R) are advantages but not essential; training in bioinformatics, data analysis and population genomics will be available for the student. Interested candidates with at least a 2.1 undergraduate degree or international equivalent can submit their CV, a letter of motivation, and two letters of recommendation or references (both including contact details) to kevin.daly[at]ucd.ie. Please note that University College Dublin has certain requirements for proficiency in the English language, which are available here  Application deadline: 3rd October  ####Relevant Literature Daly et al, 2018, “Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent”, Science Daly et al, 2021, “Herded and hunted goat genomes from the dawn of domestication in the Zagros Mountains”, PNAS Daly et al, 2025, “Ancient genomics and the origin, dispersal, and development of domestic sheep”, Science L’Hôte et al, 2024,“An 8000 years old genome reveals the Neolithic origin of the zoonosis Brucella melitensis”, Nature Communications Verdugo et al, 2019, “Ancient cattle genomics, origins, and rapid turnover in the Fertile Crescent”, Science Key et al, 2020, “Emergence of human-adapted Salmonella enterica is linked to the Neolithization process”, Nature Ecology & Evolution Light-Maka et al, 2025, Bronze Age Yersinia pestis genome from sheep sheds light on hosts and evolution of a prehistoric plague lineage, Cell"

As part of Dan’s ERC project “CODEX” I generated the first large scale genomic dataset of an ancient livestock, thus beginning my minor obsession and healthy research interest in goats.\nFollowing my PhD I had the fortunate to collaborate with Dr. Melinda Zeder on material from Ganj Dareh, one of the earliest settlements with robust evidence for goat management. Expanding the dataset of goat remains with Dr. Marjan Mashkour, Dr. Pernille Bangsgaard, and Dr. Lisa Yeoman, we created a multi-disciplinary collaboration on the world’s old managed goat herds, producing a study I am very proud of.\nI have also explored the genomics of ancient sheep, a species arguably more important than goats but perhaps less charismatic. See here for a sheep mummy genome, from a specimen we thought was initially goat, led by the peerless Dr. Conor Rossi.\nMore recently I have been awarded an SFI Pathways award to explore small ruminant pathogens in the earliest phases of livestock domestication.\nI am a member of the first cohort of the Young Academy of Ireland, the least among an exceptional group of young researchers and leaders.\nI am a proponent to alternative peer review publishing models, and have submitted manuscripts through the “Peer Community In” system. I look forward to doing so again and hope to support the movement in any way I can.\nIn my free time I watch films and maintain a list of the best goat roles in cinema. You won’t believe what’s at number one!"

Throughout my master degree i got the chance to be part of different research project: In 2021 i worked ancient woolly mammoth microbiota at the Microbial Palaeogenomics Unit of the Pasteur institute in Paris. \n\n\n\n\nThis experience gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about metagenomics techniques and ancient DNA. It is why in 2022 i decided to do my master thesis in Copenhagen in the Centre for ExoLife Sciences (CELS) where i used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics techniques to understand how microbes are surviving in Mars-like extreme environment.       I am currently Kevin Daly’s PhD student and part of the SFI Pathways project “Herd Health” . Livestock animals were domesticated 10 000 years ago in southwest Asia, but little is known about their health (inbreeding, infectious disease) despite their underpinning of farmer societies . In the last few years, the advancement of Next generation sequencing techniques has made it possible to reconstruct different genomes of ancient human pathogens from archaeological specimens, such as Yersinia pestis, the agent of the Black Death . So far, the reconstruction of pathogen genomes has mainly been performed on human pathogens . My work focuses on obtaining pathogen and animal DNA from 10,000 years old sheep and goat material, from the Zagros Mountain in Iran, in order to understand how sheep and goat zoonotic pathogen evolution was shaped by the onset of domestication .\nI’m interested in everything to do with microbes. From ancient DNA to wet lab.\n\n\nLuisa Sacristán\n\n\n¡Hola! I’m Luisa, and since 2025 I’ve been a PhD student in Kevin Daly’s Ruminant Palaeogenomics group at UCD’s School of Agriculture and Food Science.\nI completed my undergraduate degree in Microbiology at the Universidad de Pamplona, Colombia and worked for three years as a quality control microbiologist. In 2020, I started working at Gencore, a sequencing core facility at Universidad de los Andes, where I participated in multiple projects focused on sequencing a wide variety of organisms and microorganisms. Additionally, during the pandemic, I had the honor of joining the COVIDA project and later contributed to the sequencing and genomic surveillance efforts in collaboration with Colombia’s National Institute of Health contributing to the detection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. During this time, I gained experience in molecular biology techniques and different sequencing technologies.\nThe challenge of generating biological data without knowing how to analyze it motivated me to pursue a Master’s degree in Computational Biology at Universidad de los Andes in 2022 joining the Computational Biology and Microbial Ecology (BCEM) group, where I developed strong skills in biological data analysis. As part of my master’s studies, I contributed to the development of a low-cost protocol for full operon sequencing using ONT sequencing to identify bacterial communities. Additionally, I had the wonderful opportunity to join the Beasts to Craft project, where I conducted my thesis research focused on metagenomic analysis of bacterial communities found in parchment from historical manuscripts and comparative genomics of pathogens recovered from these materials.\nAfter completing my master’s, in 2024 I joined the CABANA project, developing and adapting bioinformatics e-learning courses in both spanish and english aiming to reduce language barriers in Latin America.\nCurrently, I am working on my PhD project, which aims to study the co-evolution of livestock and their pathogens by analyzing both the genomes of recovered pathogens and their host animals.
