    "text": "Hello!\n\n\n My group’s research interests are the consequences of ruminant domestication and human activity.  We study this using palaeogenomics - genome data recovered from thousands of years old bones, teeth, and other materials.  With these ancient genomes, we can peak back into prehistory to see how animals have evolved, what were past patterns of biodiversity and how they have changed, and the forces shaping modern animal diversity."

Together with Louis L’Hôte (PhD student) we are exploring the deep history of ancient animal genetic diversity, health, pathogens and how both were shaped by domestication and human activity as part of the SFI Pathways project “Herd Health”. In particular we focus on sheep and goats - small ruminants domesticated in Southwest Asia roughly 10,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n\nThe group at TCD, 2023 - new image to come"

    "text": "Group Leader: Kevin Daly\n\n\nHello!\nI am an Ad Astra Fellow - Lecturer/Assistant Professor at UCD’s School of Agriculture and Food Science, where I will lead the self-styled “Ruminant Palaeogenomics” group.\n\n\nA standard working from home day.\n\n\nI completed my undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin, where I began my academic career under the mentorship of Prof. Daniel Bradley. As part of Dan’s ERC project “CODEX” I generated the first large scale genomic dataset of an ancient livestock, thus beginning my minor obsession and healthy research interest in goats.\nFollowing my PhD I had the fortunate to collaborate with Dr. Melinda Zeder on material from Ganj Dareh, one of the earliest settlements with robust evidence for goat management. Expanding the dataset of goat remains with Dr. Marjan Mashkour, Dr. Pernille Bangsgaard, and Dr. Lisa Yeoman, we created a multi-disciplinary collaboration on the world’s old managed goat herds, producing a study I am very proud of.\nI have also explored the genomics of ancient sheep, a species arguably more important than goats but perhaps less charismatic. See here for a sheep mummy genome, from a specimen we thought was initially goat, led by the peerless Dr. Conor Rossi.\nMore recently I have been awarded an SFI Pathways award to explore small ruminant pathogens in the earliest phases of livestock domestication.\nI am a member of the first cohort of the Young Academy of Ireland, the least among an exceptional group of young researchers and leaders.\nI am a proponent to alternative peer review publishing models, and have submitted manuscripts through the “Peer Community In” system. I look forward to doing so again and hope to support the movement in any way I can.\nIn my free time I watch films and maintain a list of the best goat roles in cinema. You won’t believe what’s at number one!"

Throughout my master degree i got the chance to be part of different research project: In 2021 i worked ancient woolly mammoth microbiota at the Microbial Palaeogenomics Unit of the Pasteur institute in Paris. \n\n\n\n\nThis experience gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about metagenomics techniques and ancient DNA. It is why in 2022 i decided to do my master thesis in Copenhagen in the Centre for ExoLife Sciences (CELS) where i used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics techniques to understand how microbes are surviving in Mars-like extreme environment.       I am currently Kevin Daly’s PhD student and part of the SFI Pathways project “Herd Health” . Livestock animals were domesticated 10 000 years ago in southwest Asia, but little is known about their health (inbreeding, infectious disease) despite their underpinning of farmer societies . In the last few years, the advancement of Next generation sequencing techniques has made it possible to reconstruct different genomes of ancient human pathogens from archaeological specimens, such as Yersinia pestis, the agent of the Black Death . So far, the reconstruction of pathogen genomes has mainly been performed on human pathogens . My work focuses on obtaining pathogen and animal DNA from 10,000 years old sheep and goat material, from the Zagros Mountain in Iran, in order to understand how sheep and goat zoonotic pathogen evolution was shaped by the onset of domestication .\nI’m interested in everything to do with microbes. From ancient DNA to wet lab."

The project will investigate the genetic histories of ancient small ruminants (goat and sheep), the origins of zoonotic pathogens, and how they relate to the genomic health of herds in the deep past.\nThe position includes a student stipend of €22,000 per annum for the course of the PhD and postgraduate fees will be covered. A flexible start date within Q3/Q4 of 2024 is possible.\nContext: Genetic analysis from ancient animal remains has revealed the dynamics of the early domestication process (e.g. Daly et al 2018; Daly et al, 2021; Librado et al, 2021; Verdugo et al, 2019). However, little is known about the genomic health of domesticates - the reduction in genetic diversity which may have occurred during domestication and its possible consequences to animal health. Similarly, ancient genomic analysis has begun to shed light on the genetic history of human pathogens, including some zoonotic agents (e.g. Key et al, 2020), but how such zoonoses evolved with their domestic animal hosts is unknown.\nThe project will generate sequencing data from a diverse range of sheep and goat archaeological remains over the last 10,000 years. Recovered DNA from both host and pathogen sources will be used to reconstruct genomes and chart the interlinked evolution and genetic flux of domestic ruminants and their zoonotic pathogens. The project will involve drawing from multiple disciplines and lines of evidence including genomics, microbial/pathogen evolution, archaeology and zooarchaeology, zoology/veterinary science; a flexible approach and openness to working in multiple disciplines is expected.\nThe trainee will be mentored by Dr. Kevin Daly. The successful candidate will have opportunities to present at international & remotely run training courses and academic conferences.\nA background in any of the following is preferred: biology, genetics & genomics, domestication, population genetics, animal genomics, microbial genetics, bioinformatics, mathematical biology, archaeology. Programming and bioinformatic experience (e.g. Linux environment, R) is an advantage but not essential; training in bioinformatics, data analysis and population genomics will be available for the student.\nInterested candidates with at least a 2.1 undergraduate degree or international equivalent can submit their CV, two letters of recommendation or references, to kevin.daly[at]ucd.ie.\nReferences Daly et al, 2018, “Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent”, Science Daly et al, 2021, “Herded and hunted goat genomes from the dawn of domestication in the Zagros Mountains”, PNAS Librado et al, 2021, “The origins and spread of domestic horses from the Western Eurasian steppes”, Nature Verdugo et al, 2019, “Ancient cattle genomics, origins, and rapid turnover in the Fertile Crescent”, Science Key et al, 2020, “Emergence of human-adapted Salmonella enterica is linked to the Neolithization process”, Nature Ecology & Evolution"
