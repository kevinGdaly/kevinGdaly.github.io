    "text": "Hello!\n\n\n My group’s research interests are the consequences of ruminant domestication and human activity.  We study this using palaeogenomics - genome data recovered from thousands of years old bones, teeth, and other materials.  With these ancient genomes, we can peak back into prehistory to see how animals have evolved, what were past patterns of biodiversity and how they have changed, and the forces shaping modern animal diversity."

Together with Louis L’Hôte (PhD student) we are exploring the deep history of ancient animal genetic diversity, health, pathogens and how both were shaped by domestication and human activity as part of the SFI Pathways project “Herd Health”. In particular we focus on sheep and goats - small ruminants domesticated in Southwest Asia roughly 10,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n\nThe group at TCD, 2023 - new image to come"

    "text": "Group Leader: Kevin Daly\n\n\nHello!\nI am the leader of the self-styled “Ruminant Palaeogenomics” group at UCD’s School of Agriculture and Food Science.\n\n\nA standard WFH day.\n\n\nI completed my undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin, where I began my academic career under the mentorship of Prof. Daniel Bradley. As part of Dan’s ERC project “CODEX” I generated the first large scale genomic dataset of an ancient livestock, thus beginning my minor obsession and healthy research interest in goats.\nFollowing my PhD I had the fortunate to collaborate with Dr. Melinda Zeder on material from Ganj Dareh, one of the earliest settlements with robust evidence for goat management. Expanding the dataset of goat remains with Dr. Marjan Mashkour, Dr. Pernille Bangsgaard, and Dr. Lisa Yeoman, we created a multi-disciplinary collaboration on the world’s old managed goat herds, producing a study I am very proud of.\nI have also explored the genomics of ancient sheep, a species arguably more important than goats but perhaps less charismatic. See here for a sheep mummy genome, from a specimen we thought was initially goat, led by the peerless Dr. Conor Rossi.\nMore recently I have been awarded an SFI Pathways award to explore small ruminant pathogens in the earliest phases of livestock domestication.\nI am a member of the first cohort of the Young Academy of Ireland, the least among an exceptional group of young researchers and leaders.\nI am a proponent to alternative peer review publishing models, and have submitted manuscripts through the Peer Community In system. I look forward to doing so again and hope to support the movement in any way I can.\nIn my free time I watch films and maintain a list of the best goat roles in cinema. You won’t believe what’s at number one!"
