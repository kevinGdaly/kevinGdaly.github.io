    "text": "Hello!\n\n\n My group’s research interests are the consequences of ruminant domestication and human activity.  We study this using palaeogenomics - genome data recovered from thousands of years old bones, teeth, and other materials.  With these ancient genomes, we can peak back into prehistory to see how animals have evolved, what were past patterns of biodiversity and how they have changed, and the forces shaping modern animal diversity."

Together with Louis L’Hôte (PhD student) we are exploring the deep history of ancient animal genetic diversity, health, pathogens and how both were shaped by domestication and human activity as part of the SFI Pathways project “Herd Health”. In particular we focus on sheep and goats - small ruminants domesticated in Southwest Asia roughly 10,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n\nThe group at TCD, 2023 - new image to come"

    "text": "Group Leader: Kevin Daly\n\n\nHello!\nI am an Ad Astra Fellow - Lecturer/Assistant Professor at UCD’s School of Agriculture and Food Science, where I will lead the self-styled “Ruminant Palaeogenomics” group.\n\n\nA standard working from home day.\n\n\nI completed my undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin, where I began my academic career under the mentorship of Prof. Daniel Bradley. As part of Dan’s ERC project “CODEX” I generated the first large scale genomic dataset of an ancient livestock, thus beginning my minor obsession and healthy research interest in goats.\nFollowing my PhD I had the fortunate to collaborate with Dr. Melinda Zeder on material from Ganj Dareh, one of the earliest settlements with robust evidence for goat management. Expanding the dataset of goat remains with Dr. Marjan Mashkour, Dr. Pernille Bangsgaard, and Dr. Lisa Yeoman, we created a multi-disciplinary collaboration on the world’s old managed goat herds, producing a study I am very proud of.\nI have also explored the genomics of ancient sheep, a species arguably more important than goats but perhaps less charismatic. See here for a sheep mummy genome, from a specimen we thought was initially goat, led by the peerless Dr. Conor Rossi.\nMore recently I have been awarded an SFI Pathways award to explore small ruminant pathogens in the earliest phases of livestock domestication.\nI am a member of the first cohort of the Young Academy of Ireland, the least among an exceptional group of young researchers and leaders.\nI am a proponent to alternative peer review publishing models, and have submitted manuscripts through the “Peer Community In” system. I look forward to doing so again and hope to support the movement in any way I can.\nIn my free time I watch films and maintain a list of the best goat roles in cinema. You won’t believe what’s at number one!"

    "text": "PhD Students\n\nLouis L’Hôte\n\n\n  I am Louis, PhD student in ancient pathogen genetics.\nAfter a undegraduate degree in life science i followed a Master in Engineering in Microbiology at the Faculté des sciences et technologies, Université de Lorraine. Throughout my master degree i got the chance to be part of different research project: In 2021 i worked ancient woolly mammoth microbiota at the Microbial Palaeogenomics Unit of the Pasteur institute in Paris. \n\n\n\n\nThis experience gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about metagenomics techniques and ancient DNA. It is why in 2022 i decided to do my master thesis in Copenhagen in the Centre for ExoLife Sciences (CELS) where i used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics techniques to understand how microbes are surviving in Mars-like extreme environment.       I am currently Kevin Daly’s PhD student and part of the SFI Pathways project “Herd Health” . Livestock animals were domesticated 10 000 years ago in southwest Asia, but little is known about their health (inbreeding, infectious disease) despite their underpinning of farmer societies . In the last few years, the advancement of Next generation sequencing techniques has made it possible to reconstruct different genomes of ancient human pathogens from archaeological specimens, such as Yersinia pestis, the agent of the Black Death . So far, the reconstruction of pathogen genomes has mainly been performed on human pathogens . My work focuses on obtaining pathogen and animal DNA from 10,000 years old sheep and goat material, from the Zagros Mountain in Iran, in order to understand how sheep and goat zoonotic pathogen evolution was shaped by the onset of domestication .\nI’m interested in everything to do with microbes. From ancient DNA to wet lab.\n\n\nLuisa Sacristán\n\n\n¡Hola! I’m Luisa, and since 2025 I’ve been a PhD student in Kevin Daly’s Ruminant Palaeogenomics group at UCD’s School of Agriculture and Food Science.\nI completed my undergraduate degree in Microbiology at the Universidad de Pamplona, Colombia and worked for three years as a quality control microbiologist. In 2020, I started working at Gencore, a sequencing core facility at Universidad de los Andes, where I participated in multiple projects focused on sequencing a wide variety of organisms and microorganisms. Additionally, during the pandemic, I had the honor of joining the COVIDA project and later contributed to the sequencing and genomic surveillance efforts in collaboration with Colombia’s National Institute of Health contributing to the detection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. During this time, I gained experience in molecular biology techniques and different sequencing technologies.\nThe challenge of generating biological data without knowing how to analyze it motivated me to pursue a Master’s degree in Computational Biology at Universidad de los Andes in 2022 joining the Computational Biology and Microbial Ecology (BCEM) group, where I developed strong skills in biological data analysis. As part of my master’s studies, I contributed to the development of a low-cost protocol for full operon sequencing using ONT sequencing to identify bacterial communities. Additionally, I had the wonderful opportunity to join the Beasts to Craft project, where I conducted my thesis research focused on metagenomic analysis of bacterial communities found in parchment from historical manuscripts and comparative genomics of pathogens recovered from these materials.\nAfter completing my master’s, in 2024 I joined the CABANA project, developing and adapting bioinformatics e-learning courses in both spanish and english aiming to reduce language barriers in Latin America.\nCurrently, I am working on my PhD project, which aims to study the co-evolution of livestock and their pathogens by analyzing both the genomes of recovered pathogens and their host animals. (More details coming soon!)"
